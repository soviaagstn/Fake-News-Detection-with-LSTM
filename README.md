# Fake-News-Detection-with-LSTM

<Notes: Planning to evaluate and add some preprocessing steps to the model>



Welcome!

This project is about predicting fake news using the Fake News dataset which you can access via the following link.

I've also included the dataset files in this folder, so you can download the datasets too!

I built this model using Natural Language Processing concept in the preprocessing process, and Neural Network to build the model, more precisely the LSTM model. Here are the steps for me to make a fake news prediction.

1. Preprocessing:
     a. Remove Punctuation
     b. Lowercase Each Words
     c. Tokenization
     d. Remove Stop Words

2. Split training and testing dataset

3. Build LSTM Model using Keras

4. Make Callback function

5. Training Dataset

6. Testing Dataset
